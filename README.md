# CSVParser
CSV generic parser similar to apache commons-csv 

Although there are many simple implementations of CSV parsers, we found that the commons-csv java project is the most generic and complete as far as we know. The code is largely similar to the Java implementation with ideas from other CSV parser implementation.

This code is funtional but haven't been tested thoroughly. It's still work in progress!!!

We'll update this space with details on how to use it and the difference to commons-csv, and other implementations that we investigated.

check main.cpp for an example. It reads two type of "clean" CSV files one with header information and the other is without.
